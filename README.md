## Current Personal Project

### Vana - Simplifying Habit Tracking

I'm developing **Vana**, an in-progress habit tracker built with **Electron** and **SvelteKit**. Vana aims to revolutionize the way you track habits by offering an intuitive and powerful interface. With its minimalistic and currently evolving design, it will keep your focus on what's truly importantâ€”your habits.

Real-time progress tracking with customizable graphs based on datasets you choose.

The calendar overview will provide a comprehensive view of your habit statuses, <br>
allowing you to effortlessly add habits to specific datesâ€”whether they're <br>
one-time events, recurring, or custom schedules.<br>

Vana will store your habits locally, ensuring your data is secure and easily accessible. <br>
Plus, you will be able to import habit structures from other users with just a click, <br>
making it a collaborative and flexible tool for everyone.<br>
